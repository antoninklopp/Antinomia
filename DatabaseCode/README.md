In this folder is the database code.

The code is written in javascript.

This code is hosted on gamesparks.com servers, as well as the database with all the players informations and gets called every time a player makes a request through the game.  
To make the requests, it uses the Gamesparks plugin designed for the Unity Game Engine. A function can be called directly from the C# code (special folder GameSparksSripts in Scripts).  
Each function is called an event and you can see all the possible requests in the event folder.
