## Organisation of the Asset folder

1. In Art/Shader, you will find some shaders I used and adapted (some basic shaders I found were provided by the amazing Unity Community).

2. In resources, you will find some text used in the game, translated in English and in French.
I use an asset I created to quickly create a multi-language game. You can find the asset here :
https://github.com/antoninklopp/LanguageAssetUnity

3. In StandardAssets/Scripts you will find all the scripts from the game.
