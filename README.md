### What is Antinomia ?

Antinomia is a multiplayer card game where the goal is to beat your opponent by using the best possible collection of cards.  
It is a two player online multiplayer game.

In the beginning was Antinomia created by 2 students.  
I joined the team in July 2017, to create the video game part of the project.

### But if the game is still in development why do you put the code on Github ?

I decided to step out of the projects in May 2018, after 10 months developing alone the video game part of the project.  
I decided to put the code on Github for 2 reasons:
1. It is really important for me, as a student, to show the work I have been able to do in the past months.
2. It could be an opportunity for curious people to discover Antinomia, and if they want, to join the project.

### Which technologies do you use?

Antinomia is made with the Unity Game Engine. The entire game is coded in C#, and uses the UNet framework for the multiplayer part of the game.
Antinomia also uses https://www.gamesparks.com/ to store players information (rank, cards...) but also all information about the cards (name, type, power...).

### If this a Unity project, why did you not upload all the assets and just the code?

As I said before, Antinomia is still in development and the concept and even the game is not royalty free. Putting my code on github is only a great way for me to show the work I have done this pas months.

### Can I join the project? Can I ask you any question about the code?

If you want to join the project, you can email at this adress to get more information : antonin.klopp-tosser@grenoble-inp.org.

Feel free to ask me anything about the code, by sending me an email.
